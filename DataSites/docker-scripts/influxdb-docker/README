The basic influxdb 1.8.10 docker container.

Startup with docker-compose (e.g. docker-compose up --build).

The default setup starts influxdb with:
- listening on HTTP port 44447
- SSL disabled
- no admin user
- no databases

init-db.sh script (curl required on host) found on the root directory can be executed to create the default database setup for KIEMI/DataSites:
- admin user: USERNAME, password: PASSWORD (modify the script to use alternative credentials)
- database: ruuvit
- retention policies: autogen and 30min_mean_inf (30min average)


To change the influxdb HTTP port, modify kiemi-influxdb/influxdb.conf file:
- property "bind-address"

To enable SSL, modify kiemi-influxdb/influxdb.conf file:
- change property "https-enabled" to true
- uncomment SSL certificate path, property "https-certificate" (.crt or .pem file)
- optionally, uncommment private key path, property "https-private-key" (.key file)
NOTE: The certificate directry in the container will always be /certificates/, but remember to rename the files, if you use a different file names than those defined in the configuration file example!
- finally, copy your certificate files to kiemi-influxdb/certificates directory, they will be automatically copied to the container.


WARNING! REMEMBER TO CREATE AN ADMIN USER. USE THE init.db.sh SCRIPT OR CREATE USER MANUALLY. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO RUN THE DATABASE WITHOUT ONE.
